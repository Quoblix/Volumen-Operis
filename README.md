# Volumen-Operis 

A collection of Foundry VTT macros and the roll tables that support them. Here are the list of macros.

---

### > Randomize Monster HP 
Updates selected tokens to have a random min/max value for their HP based on their Hit Point Formula. If no formula is stored with the token, then no update to HP is made. |

### > Name Male NPCs
Updates selected tokens to have a random MALE first and last name from roll tables. To update the list of available names, edit the following roll tables:

- NPC Boys First Names
- NPC Last Names

### > Name Female NPCs
Updates selected tokens to have a random FEMALE first and last name from roll tables. To update the list of available names, edit the following roll tables:

- NPC Female First Names
- NPC Last Names

### > Name Skeletons
Updates selected tokens to have a random name from the "Skeleton Names" roll table. You can adapt this for different creatures following these steps:

1. Duplicate this Macro and the "Skeleton Names" roll table
2. Change the names in the new roll table to match the creature you want to name
3. Edit the new macro and update the rolltable that the macro should use

### > Random Occupation
Updates selected tokens to have a random occupation that will show up after their name. 

So for example, a token with the name:

  > Quoblix Hillbilus

will get changed to:

  > Quoblix Hillbilus, Goblintologist
